This is part of The Odin Project Curicculum:

I've decided to make a portfolio that differs from the design provided in the project, 
I like to see it like a first draft of my personal portfolio

## Lessons learned
I've tried some new tricks tht are not present in the curriculum but I find intresting:

# Nested CSS
It's a very intresting way to write CSS, it's awesome at first sight, but sometimes I found my self wondering 
if I'm not overusing it...making the code unreadable, I think I should practice it more in order to nest only when it's necessary

# Files organisation
I tried to be methodical in organising files, but I got lost in the process, I should read more on the methodology and of course: practice more!
